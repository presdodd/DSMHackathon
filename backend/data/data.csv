Goldfish,16-20 cm (6.3-7.87 inch),6 - 8,4 - 18°N (71.43-321.43ppm),15 - 24°C (59-75.2°F),10 - 15,"The food for Goldfish needs to be low in protein but high in carbo-hydrates, this is why it is often best to use specialist goldfish flakes or pellets to feed this fish. It is a voracious eater so the feeds should be kept down to what the fish can eat in two minutes. This should be done twice daily. Shelled peas, some blanched leaf vegetables and bloodworms should also be included in the diet. Goldfish, like most fish will always give you the impression that they are hungry. Do not be tempted to overfeed, this will lead to digestive problems in the future."
Akar betta,10 - 14 cm (3.94 - 5.51 inch),5.5 - 6.8,10 - 16°N (178.57 - 285.71ppm),22 - 28°C (71.6 - 82.4°F),2 - 3,"Akar bettas should accept all foods offered. Quality flake should be given along with treats of small live of frozen foods. Cyclops, daphnia, and brine shrimp are ideal for this."

In addition these fish will try to eat everything you give them until they almost explode, so don’t overfeed them, even if they give you the hungry eyes look. Guppies have small stomachs, so feeding them two times a day with a small amount of food is a good idea, however feeding once a day is OK too. You can offer them small flakes, small granules and they love frozen food like bloodworms, tubifex, artemias and so on. Sufficient amount of food is everything that they can eat within 2 or 3 minutes. If even after this time there is food floating around, you are overfeeding them."
